# Enterprise Architecture Frameworks 
Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks are systematic, structured approaches used to align an organization's business strategy and processes, information systems, technologies, and infrastructure with its strategic goals and objectives. These frameworks provide a comprehensive and standardized way to understand, document, and manage an enterprise's architecture.  Below are three such frameworks developed from experience.

* Technology Strategy Evaluation Framework
* Assessments Framework
* Proof of Concept Framework.

These three frameworks represent an orderly approach to align business goals and strategies to technology strategy and then evaluate the effectiveness with a proof of concept.
